Project Overview
1.1 Description
	“Repoacker”, (short-term for Report Tracker), is the program that I want to present for my Capstone Project. The idea of this program is like a professional diary, which help users to follow-up the work-flow of the project and reduce the time for generate the report in the department meeting or team meeting. Moreover, this program will alert users to update the report and notify other users when they had been included in the projects. 
1.2 Problem
Background: the reason that I want to make this program is related to my previous career. I used to be a “Junior Mechanical Engineer”, my responsible were follow up the process of the manufacturing line and made sure resolve any issues that happened. Therefore, my daily tasks were recorded the issued, sign the tasks for responsible departments, collected the newest update and hosting the meeting. However, sometimes it took more time than me what I expected to generate the report for meeting and create the tickets for other departments. The reason for these issues was due to much of the updates were submitted by email or stored in their departments network, so if I want to generate the report, I needed to review all the email in that day and required the responsible department to provide their latest updates.  This was not only wasting my time to work on other tasks, but also cause the delay to the project.

Solution: from the program I want to have users save the time from generate the report, easier to review the project workflow and catch up with the deadline.

1.3 User Profile
The target users for the programs are students, Engineers and organization that need to generated the daily, weekly or monthly reports.
1.4 Requirements: Use Cases and Features
Use Case:
1)	Users need to have the update for the tasks in the project.
2)	Team meeting that required reported for tracking the project.
3)	Catch up with the workflow.
4)	Lot of difference case, but mainly, the program is for project tracking and summary. 
Feature:
1)	Basic: The basic function that this program will provide to user include:
a.	Generate the work flow of the project by the open tasks, percent of completion in different period of time and track the deadline.
b.	User submit the report of the tasks that they response and program will generate the final report based on user comments.
c.	Alert the deadline of the report submission and the deadline of the tasks.
2)	Diving Deeper: (following tasks will online be work on once the basic function is finish)
a.	login
b.	Users can assign order users if they relate to the open tasks.
c.	 Meeting setting and demo of meeting.
d.	Generate difference report base on selected users.
e.	Project time estimating.
f.	Share file link.
1.5 Tech Stack and APIs (TBD)
